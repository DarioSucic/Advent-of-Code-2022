# Advent of Code 2022 ✨

AoC repo with the goal of posting solutions almost exactly as they were when the stars were acquired.

Allowed cleanup: reordering lines, removing unused variables. If further changes are necessary (ie. due to slow runtime) the original code will be put in a string block above the revised code.
